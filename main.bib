  title       = {Metamodel-based sensitivity analysis: Polynomial chaos expansions and Gaussian processes},
  abstract    = {Global sensitivity analysis is now established as a powerful approach for determining the key random input parameters that drive the uncertainty of model output predictions. Yet the classical computation of the so-called Sobol' indices is based on Monte Carlo simulation, which is not affordable when computationally expensive models are used, as it is the case in most applications in engineering and applied sciences. In this respect metamodels such as polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and Gaussian processes (GP) have received tremendous attention in the last few years, as they allow one to replace the original, taxing model by a surrogate which is built from an experimental design of limited size. Then the surrogate can be used to compute the sensitivity indices in negligible time. In this chapter an introduction to each technique is given, with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations in the context of global sensitivity analysis. In particular, Sobol' (resp. total Sobol') indices can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients. In contrast, confidence intervals on sensitivity indices can be derived straightforwardly from the properties of GPs. The performance of the two techniques is finally compared on three well-known analytical benchmarks (Ishigami, G-Sobol and Morris functions) as well as on a realistic engineering application (deflection of a truss structure).},

The methods compared are Monte Carlo with pseudo-random numbers, Latin Hypercube Sampling, and Quasi Monte Carlo with sampling based on Sobol sequences. Generally results show superior performance of the Quasi Monte Carlo approach based on Sobol sequences in line with theoretical predictions. Latin Hypercube Sampling can be more efficient than both Monte Carlo method and Quasi Monte Carlo method but the latter inequality holds for a reduced set of function typology and at small number of sampled points. In conclusion Quasi Monte Carlo method would appear the safest bet when integrating functions of unknown typology.},

  abstract = {The Separations Research Program (SRP) pilot plant is located at The University of Texas (UT) Pickle Research Campus and has been operated as a carbon capture facility since 2002. The semi-works scale pilot facility uses air and 3–14 mol% CO2 as flue gas as it applies the latest advancements in carbon dioxide recovery technology. The capacity of the pilot plant is approximately 15 m3/min of gas and 130 liters/min of solvent. Past experimental studies include solvent performance characterization using potassium carbonate with piperazine, monoethanolamine, concentrated piperazine and other proprietary solvents. In recent years, the pilot plant has been utilized to determine the mass transfer and hydraulic characteristics of various structured and random packings using amine-based solvents for CO2 absorption. In 2002, the UT/SRP began developing improved measurement techniques and operating procedures to ensure reliable process control and closure of material and energy balances. Past experience and learning with the UT/SRP pilot plant is currently being utilized for the design and operation of several future pilot plants that will process actual coal-fired flue gas. The purpose of the presentation is to provide a brief description of the UT/SRP CO2 capture pilot plant capabilities, innovative operational procedures and instrument accuracies. The objectives of this paper are to discuss SRP pilot plant experience including: process description, operations and control, key equipment, measurement methods including novel techniques, overall process performance, and future work.},

  abstract    = {Kernel methods are among the most popular techniques in machine learning. From a frequentist/discriminative perspective they play a central role in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a Bayesian/generative perspective they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is also known as the covariance function. Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning. In this paper, we review different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic and functional methods.},

Numerous statistical and probabilistic tools (regression, smoothing, tests, statistical learning, Monte Carlo, \ldots) aim at determining the model input variables which mostly contribute to an interest quantity depending on model output. This quantity can be for instance the variance of an output variable. Three kinds of methods are distinguished: the screening (coarse sorting of the most influential inputs among a large number), the measures of importance (quantitative sensitivity indices) and the deep exploration of the model behaviour (measuring the effects of inputs on their all variation range). A progressive application methodology is illustrated on a scholar application. A synthesis is given to place every method according to several axes, mainly the cost in number of model evaluations, the model complexity and the nature of brought information.},

  abstract    = {Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods are useful for optimizing functions that are expen- sive to evaluate, lack an analytical expression and whose evaluations can be contaminated by noise. These methods rely on a probabilistic model of the objective function, typically a Gaussian process (GP), upon which an acquisition function is built. The acquisition function guides the optimization process and measures the expected utility of performing an evaluation of the objective at a new point. GPs assume continous input variables. When this is not the case, for example when some of the input variables take categorical or integer values, one has to introduce extra approximations. Consider a suggested input location taking values in the real line. Before doing the evaluation of the objective, a common approach is to use a one hot encoding approximation for categorical variables, or to round to the closest integer, in the case of integer-valued variables. We show that this can lead to problems in the optimization process and describe a more principled approach to account for input variables that are categorical or integer-valued. We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the utility of our approach, which significantly improves the results of standard BO methods using Gaussian processes on problems with categorical or integer-valued variables.},

Global sensitivity analysis aims to identify the parameters whose uncertainty has the largest impact on the variability of a quantity of interest (output of the model). One of the statistical tools used to quantify the influence of each input variable on the output is the Sobol sensitivity index. We consider the statistical estimation of this index from a finite sample of model outputs: we present two estimators and state a central limit theorem for each. We show that one of these estimators has an optimal asymptotic variance. We also generalize our results to the case where the true output is not observable, and is replaced by a noisy version.},

  abstract    = {Computer experiments are becoming increasingly important in scientific investigations. In the presence of uncertainty, analysts employ probabilistic sensitivity methods to identify the key-drivers of change in the quantities of interest. Simulation complexity, large dimensionality and long running times may force analysts to make statistical inference at small sample sizes. Methods designed to estimate probabilistic sensitivity measures at relatively low computational costs are attracting increasing interest. We propose a fully Bayesian approach to the estimation of probabilistic sensitivity measures based on a one-sample design. We discuss, first, new estimators based on placing piecewise constant priors on the conditional distributions of the output given each input, by partitioning the input space. We then present two alternatives, based on Bayesian non-parametric density estimation, which bypass the need for predefined partitions. In all cases, the Bayesian paradigm guarantees the quantification of uncertainty in the estimation process through the posterior distribution over the sensitivity measures, without requiring additional simulator evaluations. The performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of traditional point estimators in a series of numerical experiments comprising synthetic but challenging simulators, as well as a realistic application. $\textit{An Updated Version of the Manuscript is Forthcoming in Statistics and Computing.}$},

A feature of many computer experiments is that the output is deterministic--rerunning the code with the same inputs gives identical observations. Often, the codes are computationally expensive to run, and a common objective of an experiment is to fit a cheaper predictor of the output to the data. Our approach is to model the deterministic output as the realization of a stochastic process, thereby providing a statistical basis for designing experiments (choosing the inputs) for efficient prediction. With this model, estimates of uncertainty of predictions are also available. Recent work in this area is reviewed, a number of applications are discussed, and we demonstrate our methodology with an example.},

  abstract    = {The growing need for uncertainty analysis of complex computational models has led to an expanding use of meta-models across engineering and sciences. The efficiency of meta-modeling techniques relies on their ability to provide statistically-equivalent analytical representations based on relatively few evaluations of the original model. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) have proven a powerful tool for developing meta-models in a wide range of applications; the key idea thereof is to expand the model response onto a basis made of multivariate polynomials obtained as tensor products of appropriate univariate polynomials. The classical PCE approach nevertheless faces the "curse of dimensionality", namely the exponential increase of the basis size with increasing input dimension. To address this limitation, the sparse PCE technique has been proposed, in which the expansion is carried out on only a few relevant basis terms that are automatically selected by a suitable algorithm. An alternative for developing meta-models with polynomial functions in high-dimensional problems is offered by the newly emerged low-rank approximations (LRA) approach. By exploiting the tensor-product structure of the multivariate basis, LRA can provide polynomial representations in highly compressed formats. Through extensive numerical investigations, we herein first shed light on issues relating to the construction of canonical LRA with a particular greedy algorithm involving a sequential updating of the polynomial coefficients along separate dimensions. Canonical LRA exhibit smaller errors than sparse PCE in cases when the number of available model evaluations is small with respect to the input dimension. By introducing the conditional generalization error, we further demonstrate that canonical LRA tend to outperform sparse PCE in the prediction of extreme model responses.},

Statistical emulators are computationally cheap approxima- tions of such simulators. They can be built to replace simulators for various purposes, such as the propagation of uncertainties from inputs to outputs or the calibration of some internal parameters against observations. However, when the input space is of high dimension, the construction of an emulator can become prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we introduce a joint framework merg- ing emulation with dimension reduction in order to overcome this hurdle. The gradient-based kernel dimension reduction technique is chosen due to its ability to drastically decrease dimensionality with little loss in information. The Gaussian process emulation technique is combined with this dimen- sion reduction approach. Theoretical properties of the approximation are explored. Our proposed approach provides an answer to the dimension reduction issue in emulation for a wide range of sim- ulation problems that cannot be tackled using existing methods. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework is demonstrated theoretically and compared with other methods on an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) problem. We finally present a realistic application to tsunami modeling. The uncertainties in the bathymetry (sea floor elevation) are modeled as high-dimensional realizations of a spatial process using a geostatistical approach. Our dimension-reduced emulation enables us to compute the impact of these uncertainties on resulting possible tsunami wave heights near-shore and on-shore. Considering an uncertain earthquake source, we observe a significant in- crease in the spread of uncertainties in the tsunami heights due to the contribution of the bathymetry uncertainties to the overall uncertainty budget. These results highlight the need to include the effect of uncertainties in the bathymetry in tsunami early warnings and risk assessments.},

When these directions correspond to coordinate directions, one may apply global sensitivity measures to determine the most influential parameters. However, these methods perform poorly when the directions of variability are not aligned with the natural coordinates of the input space. We present a method to first detect the directions of the strongest variability using evaluations of the gradient and subsequently exploit these directions to construct a response surface on a low-dimensional subspace-i.e., the active subspace-of the inputs. We develop a theoretical framework with error bounds, and we link the theoretical quantities to the parameters of a kriging response surface on the active subspace. We apply the method to an elliptic PDE model with coefficients parameterized by 100 Gaussian random variables and compare it with a local sensitivity analysis method for dimension reduction.},

  abstract        = {Active subspaces can effectively reduce the dimension of high-dimensional parameter studies enabling otherwise infeasible experiments with expensive simulations. The key components of active subspace methods are the eigenvectors of a symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix whose elements are the average products of partial derivatives of the simulation's input/output map. We study a Monte Carlo method for approximating the eigenpairs of this matrix. We offer both theoretical results based on recent non-asymptotic random matrix theory and a practical approach based on the bootstrap. We extend the analysis to the case when the gradients are approximated, for example, with finite differences. Our goal is to provide guidance for two questions that arise in active subspaces: (i) How many gradient samples does one need to accurately approximate the eigenvalues and subspaces? (ii) What can be said about the accuracy of the estimated subspace, both theoretically and practically? We test the approach on both simple quadratic functions where the active subspace is known and a parameterized PDE with 100 variables characterizing the coefficients of the differential operator.},

  abstract        = {To increase the dependability of complex systems, one solution is to assess their state of health continuously through the monitoring of variables sensitive to potential degradation modes. When computed in an operating environment, these variables, known as health indicators, are subject to many uncertainties. Hence, the stochastic nature of health assessment combined with the lack of data in design stages makes it difficult to evaluate the efficiency of a health indicator before the system enters into service. This paper introduces a method for early validation of health indicators during the design stages of a system development process. This method uses physics-based modeling and uncertainties propagation to create simulated stochastic data. However, because of the large number of parameters defining the model and its computation duration, the necessary runtime for uncertainties propagation is prohibitive. Thus, kriging is used to obtain low computation time estimations of the model outputs. Moreover, sensitivity analysis techniques are performed upstream to determine the hierarchization of the model parameters and to reduce the dimension of the input space. The validation is based on three types of numerical key performance indicators corresponding to the detection, identification and prognostic processes. After having introduced and formalized the framework of uncertain systems modeling and the different performance metrics, the issues of sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling are addressed. The method is subsequently applied to the validation of a set of health indicators for the monitoring of an aircraft engine's pumping unit. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Automatic relevance determination (ARD) and the closely-related sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework are effective tools for pruning large numbers of irrelevant features leading to a sparse explanatory subset. However, popular update rules used for ARD are either difficult to extend to more general problems of interest or are characterized by non-ideal convergence properties. Moreover, it remains unclear exactly how ARD relates to more traditional MAP estimation-based methods for learning sparse representations (e.g., the Lasso). This paper furnishes an alternative means of expressing the ARD cost function using auxiliary functions that naturally addresses both of these issues. First, the proposed reformulation of ARD can naturally be optimized by solving a series of re-weighted 1 problems. The result is an efficient, extensible algorithm that can be implemented using standard convex programming toolboxes and is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum (or saddle point). Secondly, the analysis reveals that ARD is exactly equivalent to performing standard MAP estimation in weight space using a particular feature- and noise-dependent, non-factorial weight prior. We then demonstrate that this implicit prior maintains several desirable advantages over conventional priors with respect to feature selection. Overall these results suggest alternative cost functions and update procedures for selecting features and promoting sparse solutions in a variety of general situations. In particular, the methodology readily extends to handle problems such as non-negative sparse coding and covariance component estimation. 1},

This is the idea at the core of multi-task learning. In this context a fundamental question is how to incorporate the tasks structure in the learning problem.We tackle this question by studying a general computational framework that allows to encode a-priori knowledge of the tasks structure in the form of a convex penalty; in this setting a variety of previously proposed methods can be recovered as special cases, including linear and non-linear approaches. Within this framework, we show that tasks and their structure can be efficiently learned considering a convex optimization problem that can be approached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating minimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum.},

  abstract    = {Optimization problems with uncertain black-box constraints, modeled by warped Gaussian processes, have recently been considered in the Bayesian optimization setting. This work introduces a new class of constraints in which the same black-box function occurs multiple times evaluated at different domain points. Such constraints are important in applications where, e.g., safety-critical measures are aggregated over multiple time periods. Our approach, which uses robust optimization, reformulates these uncertain constraints into deterministic constraints guaranteed to be satisfied with a specified probability, i.e., deterministic approximations to a chance constraint. This approach extends robust optimization methods from parametric uncertainty to uncertain functions modeled by warped Gaussian processes. We analyze convexity conditions and propose a custom global optimization strategy for non-convex cases. A case study derived from production planning and an industrially relevant example from oil well drilling show that the approach effectively mitigates uncertainty in the learned curves. For the drill scheduling example, we develop a custom strategy for globally optimizing integer decisions.},

We present a mathematical and software framework for scalable approximate inference in GPs, which combines interdomain approximations and multiple outputs.

  abstract     = {The optimization of high dimensional functions is a key issue in engineering problems but it frequently comes at a cost that is not acceptable since it usually involves a complex and expensive computer code. Engineers often overcome this limitation by first identifying which parameters drive the most the function variations: non-influential variables are set to a fixed value and the optimization procedure is carried out with the remaining influential variables. Such variable selection is performed through influence measures that are meaningful for regression problems. However it does not account for the specific structure of optimization problems where we would like to identify which variables most lead to constraints satisfaction and low values of the objective function. In this paper, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that accounts for the specific aspects of optimization problems. In particular, we introduce an influence measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to characterize whether a design variable matters to reach low values of the objective function and to satisfy the constraints. This sensitivity measure makes it possible to sort the inputs and reduce the problem dimension. We compare a random and a greedy strategies to set the values of the non-influential variables before conducting a local optimization. Applications to several test-cases show that this variable selection and the greedy strategy significantly reduce the number of function evaluations at a limited cost in terms of solution performance.},

  abstract    = {Sensitivity analysis helps identify which model inputs convey the most uncertainty to the model output. One of the most authoritative measures in global sensitivity analysis is the Sobol' total-order index, which can be computed with several different estimators. Although previous comparisons exist, it is hard to know which estimator performs best since the results are contingent on the benchmark setting defined by the analyst (the sampling method, the distribution of the model inputs, the number of model runs, the test function or model and its dimensionality, the weight of higher order effects or the performance measure selected). Here we compare several total-order estimators in an eight-dimension hypercube where these benchmark parameters are treated as random parameters. This arrangement significantly relaxes the dependency of the results on the benchmark design. We observe that the most accurate estimators are Razavi and Gupta's, Jansen's or Janon/Monod's for factor prioritization, and Jansen's, Janon/Monod's or Azzini and Rosati's for approaching the "true" total-order indices. The rest lag considerably behind. Our work helps analysts navigate the myriad of total-order formulae by reducing the uncertainty in the selection of the most appropriate estimator.},

  abstract      = {Bayesian Optimization, the application of Bayesian function approximation to finding optima of expensive functions, has exploded in popularity in recent years. In particular, much attention has been paid to improving its efficiency on problems with many parameters to optimize. This attention has trickled down to the workhorse of high dimensional BO, high dimensional Gaussian process regression, which is also of independent interest. The great flexibility that the Gaussian process prior implies is a boon when modeling complicated, low dimensional surfaces but simply says too little when dimension grows too large. A variety of structural model assumptions have been tested to tame high dimensions, from variable selection and additive decomposition to low dimensional embeddings and beyond. Most of these approaches in turn require modifications of the acquisition function optimization strategy as well. Here we review the defining structural model assumptions and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches in practice.},

The key property of this formulation is that the inducing inputs  are defined to be variational parameters  which are selected by minimizing  the Kullback-Leibler divergence between  the variational distribution and the exact posterior distribution over the latent function values.

  title         = {Infinitely Wide Tensor Networks as Gaussian Process},
  year          = {2021},
  month         = jan,
  abstract      = {Gaussian Process is a non-parametric prior which can be understood as a distribution on the function space intuitively. It is known that by introducing appropriate prior to the weights of the neural networks, Gaussian Process can be obtained by taking the infinite-width limit of the Bayesian neural networks from a Bayesian perspective. In this paper, we explore the infinitely wide Tensor Networks and show the equivalence of the infinitely wide Tensor Networks and the Gaussian Process. We study the pure Tensor Network and another two extended Tensor Network structures: Neural Kernel Tensor Network and Tensor Network hidden layer Neural Network and prove that each one will converge to the Gaussian Process as the width of each model goes to infinity. (We note here that Gaussian Process can also be obtained by taking the infinite limit of at least one of the bond dimensions $\alpha_{i}$ in the product of tensor nodes, and the proofs can be done with the same ideas in the proofs of the infinite-width cases.) We calculate the mean function (mean vector) and the covariance function (covariance matrix) of the finite dimensional distribution of the induced Gaussian Process by the infinite-width tensor network with a general set-up. We study the properties of the covariance function and derive the approximation of the covariance function when the integral in the expectation operator is intractable. In the numerical experiments, we implement the Gaussian Process corresponding to the infinite limit tensor networks and plot the sample paths of these models. We study the hyperparameters and plot the sample path families in the induced Gaussian Process by varying the standard deviations of the prior distributions. As expected, the parameters in the prior distribution namely the hyper-parameters in the induced Gaussian Process controls the characteristic lengthscales of the Gaussian Process.},
